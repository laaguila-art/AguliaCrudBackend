# 🚨 Important Note About Registration

## Backend Server Info

The backend is hosted on **Render's free tier**, which means:

⏰ **The server sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity**

### If Registration Fails:

1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - The server might be waking up
2. **Try again** - First request wakes the server, second works
3. **Use a unique username** - "admin1" might already exist

### Quick Fix:

Before registering, open this link in a new tab to wake the server:
👉 https://aguliacrudbackend.onrender.com

Wait 30 seconds, then try registering!

### Alternative usernames to try:
- admin2
- admin3
- yourname123
- testuser

### Still having issues?

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try registering
3. Check for error messages
4. See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for more help

**The server is now awake!** Try registering again. 😊
